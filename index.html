          <h2>The Wizard of Hockey</h2>
          <p>
            Major Dhyan Chand (29 August 1905 - 3 December 1979) was an Indian
            field hockey player, regarded by many as the greatest field hockey
            player in history. He was known for his extraordinary ball control
            and goal-scoring feats, in addition to earning three Olympic gold
            medals, in 1928, 1932 and 1936, during an era where India dominated
            field hockey. His influence extended beyond these victories, as
            India won the field hockey event in seven out of eight Olympics from
            1928 to 1964. Known as The Wizard or The Magician of hockey for his
            superb ball control, Chand played internationally from 1926 to 1949,
            where he scored 570 goals in 185 matches according to his
            autobiography, Goal, and over 1000 goals in his entire domestic and
            international career. BBC called him the "hockey's equivalent of
            Muhammad Ali". The Government of India awarded Chand India's third
            highest civilian honour, the Padma Bhushan in 1956. His birthday, 29
            August, is celebrated as National Sports Day in India every year.
            India's highest sporting honour, Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award
            is named after him.
